Siding is functional, but it also serves the purpose of aesthetic appeal. Joseph Ketner Construction understands the importance of this to you as a homeowner, that‚Äôs why meticulous care is taken to ensure your home‚Äôs exterior siding looks beautiful!

Since 2002, Joseph Ketner Construction (JKC) has been serving the Portland Metro area, siding hundreds of homes. We pride ourselves on having a top rating on Angie‚Äôs List as a ‚ÄúSuper Service Award‚Äù winner. From our experienced project management, to our professionally trained and careful crew, JKC will provide you with excellent quality installation and materials for your home siding project.

We meet with our siding representatives frequently throughout the year. We also attend classes offered by the CCB to make sure we are up to code.

Types of siding and exteriors we install:
<ul>
	<li>HardiePlank¬Æ lap siding</li>
	<li>Prime Cedar Natural Wood</li>
</ul>
JKC is fully trained and equipped to professionally deliver any siding repair or replacement job. We even offer a 7 year warranty on labor an installation. Your siding will also come with a warranty, for instance, Hardiplank currently has a 30 year non-prorated warranty.

Schedule an <a href="/contact">in-home consultation</a> with us to get started in improving your home with beautiful new siding installed right the first time!

Not sure what you want it to look like? We can help. We can talk about ideas and <a href="/exterior-design">design</a> a plan customized to your home. <a href="/contact">Contact us for design services.</a>
<h4>Important Code Change that Affects Your Home</h4>
The Oregon legislature passed a code change in 2010 in the way building envelopes are assembled, which requires the drainage plane between the exterior cladding and the building envelope for a weather resistant barrier. Before this legislature passed, there were many construction lawsuits. JKC is well versed in the code change. We have repaired many faulty siding installations and know what it takes to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again. If wall insulation is affected, we partner with insulation contractors to take care of the damage.

That‚Äôs why the owner, Joe Ketner, began his ‚ÄúGiving Back‚Äù program.  Joe believes that contributing to organizations that help those who are less fortunate is necessary for communities to thrive.  He feels that supporting organizations in the community, such as Habitat for Humanity and Portland Rescue Mission that aid in getting people out of poverty is one way to strengthen the community, making it a better place to live for everyone.</p>  
<p>Every year JKC will donate a portion of their profits to nonprofit programs that help the community.  Additionally, JKC participates through labor in the Habitat for Humanity Blitzbuild.</p>  
<blockquote>Home Builders Blitz is an exciting opportunity for Habitat for Humanity affiliates and professional builders to partner together to build and renovate homes across the U.S. New partnership opportunities are available for builders whose specialties are outside of new residential construction. ‚Äì Habitat for Humanity</blockquote>
<p>If you are a homeowner interested in working with JKC on your home remodeling project, and know of a deserving organization to receive a donation, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>

Remodeling and upgrading your existing home is inherently more efficient and much less wasteful than new construction, but at JKC, we take it further than this because we believe in reducing our impact on the planet. This means careful planning from the very beginning to prevent unnecessary waste, conserve energy, and be more efficient. This also means keeping you informed of how being sustainable can benefit you, and save you money. Some of the ways that JKC prioritizes sustainability:
<ul>
	<li>We recycle wood and metal products whenever possible.</li>
	<li>We use high quality lifetime rated caulking and paint products, to reduce future maintenance cycles.</li>
	<li>We partner with EnergyTrust of Oregon to give you incentives for upgrading and making your home more efficient through insulation and window replacement.</li>
	<li>We use sustainable products whenever possible.</li>
	<li>Window and insulation replacements meet or exceed the energy requirements Federal tax credits and EnergyTrust cash rebates.</li>
