Installing a new deck into your home can be one of the most monumental tasks that your residential property will ever see. Building and installing <strong><a href="http://josephketnerconstruction.com/">decks</a></strong> can be one of the most time sensitive and complicated tasks that you will ever come across - especially if you are not a weekend warrior that typically tackles projects of this magnitude alone. Below are a few tips that will help you to get the help that you need in an effort to build and install a new deck into your home. By following them, you are going to have a new deck that is the envy of your entire neighborhood.

<strong>¬†</strong>

<strong>Ask your friends</strong>

<strong>¬†</strong>

If you have at least one friend that is handy with building and installing decks, then consider asking them to set aside some time and help you to build and install your home‚Äôs new deck. If you have more than one friend that has experience in this, consider asking them to join you and aid you in building and installing your deck as well. This is a case of more actually being the merrier, because the more help you can get? The better your deck is going to look, and is the quicker you can have it properly built and installed into your residential property!

<strong>¬†</strong>

<strong>Family members</strong>

<strong>¬†</strong>

Alternatively, if you have a few handymen/handywomen that has experience in building installing decks, consider asking them to come over and help you with building and installing your new deck. If your family members know your friends and vice versa - and most importantly, they all get along together quite well - consider mixing both your friends and your family together to aid you in building and installing your new deck. The more hands you have on the project and the more people working toward the ultimate goal of helping you to get that deck that you have always wanted installed on your home, the better the entire project will be!

<strong>¬†</strong>

<strong>Advertise locally</strong>

<strong>¬†</strong>

Consider placing a few flyers around your neighborhood, advertising that you are wanting to find the few dependable people to help you with building and installing your new deck. Unlike with your friends and family, you will probably have to hire these people since they will be more acquaintances then friends. Even so, if you want a little bit of help on this project, advertising locally is one of the best approach is to take.

<strong>¬†</strong>

<strong>Craigslist</strong>

<strong>¬†</strong>

Finally, consider hiring a few people from Craigslist to aid you in building and installing your new deck over the weekend. With so many people constantly checking Craigslist in every area of the United States, someone is bound to come across your ad and will likely ask you pretty quickly after the ad if you are still looking for people to help you with your deck. Let them know that you are, asking them if they have experience with building decks, and from there hire accordingly. Getting help with your new deck may seem like a long shot, but in the end, it is actually quite possible to get a that you need and deserve!

Although <strong><a href="http://josephketnerconstruction.com/">HardiePlank lap siding</a></strong> (also known as cement board siding) has been around for a very long time, it is still one of the best, state-of-the-art ways to give your home a look that will last a lifetime.

<strong>¬†</strong>

<strong>Lasts a long time</strong>

<strong>¬†</strong>

This warranty is not included just because it sounds good on paper: HardiePlank¬Æ lap siding is actually meant to last that long and more. This is because this type of siding will never be damaged by the likes of rot, insects, and the elements of weather like traditional, vinyl siding. For as long as you own your home, it is a near guarantee that you will never have to replace your HardiePlank¬Æ lap siding again!

<strong>¬†</strong>

<strong>Looks immaculate</strong>

<strong>¬†</strong>

If you want your home to have that ‚Äòreal wood‚Äô feeling without the cost of actual wood, then HardiePlank¬Æ lap siding delivers the best of both worlds!

<strong>¬†</strong>

<strong>Resistant to fire and storms</strong>

<strong>¬†</strong>

<strong>Will never expand/contract</strong>

<strong>¬†</strong>

Then it is time that you inquire about <strong><a href="http://josephketnerconstruction.com/">window replacement</a></strong> for your home. There are many different reasons why you would want to replace your windows (other than the obvious reason being that they look worn an old), and each one of the reasons is a great reason to replace your current windows. Below are a few of the top reasons why so many homeowners like yourself need window replacements.

<strong>The look</strong>

One of the main reasons why homeowners opt for window replacement is that their current windows do not look as acceptable as they have in the past. Over time, windows a road away and start to look worse for wear. This can worsen the look of your home, which could drive down the overall value of your home and even your neighbor‚Äôs homes! If you take pride in your residential property (and we know that you do), then you will want to consider replacing your current windows and installing new windows to give your home a look that will impress everyone that drives by it!

<strong>Security</strong>

Modern windows will protect your home even better than your current windows. Because modern windows are tested for forced entry and include multiple locks to improve the safety of your home, you can take solace in knowing that whenever you install a new, modern window into your home, you will be protecting the sanctity of your home, your family, and every aspect of your property.

<strong>Costliness</strong>

If you and your family wish to tighten the family budget, one of the things you should not cut out of your budget is the replacement of new windows. Window replacement not only makes your home look better and increases the security of the property, but it will also save you a substantial amount of money annually. By installing new windows, this decreases heating costs, reduces maintenance, increases the value of your home, and generally makes your home stay comfortable year-round. If you hate spending an absurd amount of money on your heating or cooling bills every year, new windows will fix this!

<strong>Comfortability</strong>

Finally, replacing your windows will also allow you to live more comfortably than ever in your residential property. We mentioned that window replacement allows you to decrease the amount you will spend annually on heating and cooling, and this is because it actually traps the heat and cool air inside of your home so that your central heating and cooling system does not have to continuously be operating (thus increasing the amount you spend annually on electricity).

This will make your home exponentially more comfortable to live in. This is one of the biggest positives of installing new windows into your home. Because you never have to fight keep your home at a comfortable temperature, you can live happy and comfortably in your residential property going forward.

Unfortunately, too many people get so caught up in the end result that they forget to take precautionary steps to make sure everything goes smoothly and ends safely. This causes a lot of people to sustain injuries from projects that could be easily avoided.

&nbsp;

There are a lot of ways that you can help prevent yourself from becoming injured during your DIY project. Identifying them is the first step toward making sure that you stay as safe as possible. Here are a few of the most common injuries that are sustained from various <a href="JosephKetnerConstruction.com">DIY projects.</a>

&nbsp;

<strong>The Use of Power Tools</strong>

<strong>¬†</strong>

Sometimes injuries can be caused simply from the equipment that is being used. IN order to prevent these things it is important to be thoroughly educated on how each tool and piece of equipment works before trying to use it in a project. This will not only help the project to turn out appropriately, but also keep you safe.
<ul>
	<li>Ladders are ironically one of the highest injury-related objects in construction. Over 170,000 people are injured each year because of a ladder accident. Always be sure that you inspect ladders thoroughly before their use to ensure the highest safety and have someone help you as well.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Tools are another big issue. Whether you are working on Siding Repair or Replacement, or Window Replacement and Installation, using the wrong table tools or hand tools in the wrong way can easily cause injury. Big saws and other power tools are dangerous without knowing how to use them, but even something as simple as a hammer can be dangerous without proper technique. Learn how to use equipment appropriately and do not operate anything heavy while on medication or alcohol.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Common Everyday Accidents</strong>

<strong>¬†</strong>

Other times, the injuries are caused simply from everyday common accidents or things done in an improper way. Being aware of these issues is one of the best ways to prevent them in the future.

&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Sometimes, something as simple as lawn work can go awry if you don‚Äôt know how to utilize the lawn equipment.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Even the simplest projects like Bathroom Remodeling, Interior Remodeling and Roofing can cause some of the worst injuries if you are not careful.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>The biggest key to making sure you stay safe during any DIY project is to be aware and educated on how things work, and also to have an extra pair of hands on deck at all times. Both of these practices can insure you stay safe and get work done.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

As you can see, many injuries overlap in commonality with DIY projects. Whether you are looking for a complete Historic Restoration or a simple Kitchen Remodeling, you can take preventative steps to make sure that you don‚Äôt become another construction statistic. Being educated about processes and equipment is a great way to establish safety rules as well as make sure you are able to complete the project with as much success as you want. For more information regarding safety, or to get an In-Home Consultation, check out or contact a Design Build Service near you.

However, to you it seems that something might be missing from the perfect family picture in the back yard. You think about it for a bit, and realize that the thing that would complete your perfect picture is a deck. You decide that instead of building the deck yourself, you will call in the professionals who specialize in building decks for a living. Read on below for some things that you need to know when you are looking to have a <a href="http://www.josephketnerconstruction.com/">deck installed</a>.

<strong>Take a Trip to City Hall</strong>

The first thing you will need to do is take a trip to the city hall in your area to see if decks are allowed in your neighborhood. Remember, that construction of large structures like a deck usually require a permit that you will need to get from city hall. Whatever contractor you choose to install the deck for you can tell you exactly what it is you will need; if that is the route, you choose to go.

Make sure to ask about the tax implications of adding a deck to your home as well. Many homeowners do not think about these things but you need to, so as not to run into problems on down the road.

<strong>Do Your Research and Find the Right Team </strong>

Just like with any other contractors out there, you want the best team to install your deck at the most inexpensive price. Remember, deck installation requires experience above and beyond what your average contractor is capable of. In other words, do not hire the roofing company down the street to install your deck, because it might not turn out the way that you were planning.

Do your research, talk to different people, and then take your time choosing the best deck installation team to meet your needs.

<strong>Set the Right Expectations</strong>

No two decks are going to be the same. They are each unique in their own way. A solidly built deck will enhance the look of your property, be useful to your family, and increase the value of your home as well. You should look to spend quite a bit to have a quality deck installed. The old adage you get what you pay for is very apt in this situation.

<strong>¬†Make Sure to Maintain Your Deck</strong>

Today, you can hire a <a href="http://www.josephketnerconstruction.com/">design build service</a> to do the job just as well. Of course, as with any type of service, there are going to be pros and cons to this type of service as well. Read on below for some of the pros and cons to choosing design build services over traditional services today.

<strong>What is a Design Build Service?</strong>

Design build is a system where the same building and remodeling team work under a single contractor in order to get the building and the remodeling done on a home. It is a good way to forgo having to work with many different contractors during the process of getting your home built and remodeled and in the end will save you money as well.

<strong>Pros of Design Build</strong>

There are many more advantages than disadvantages to using this type of service. Read on below for a few of them.

<strong>Everyone is on the Same Team</strong>

All of the workers are in the project together and have the same goal. That goal is to finish the job on schedule, under budget, and to the homeowner‚Äôs satisfaction.

<strong>Total Accountability</strong>

One of the major pros of using this type of service is the fact that one team is held responsible for the entire project, instead of a series of different contractors that will try to lay the blame on the other contractors on the job.

<strong>Continuity on the Project</strong>

The chance for details to fall through the cracks is lessened when you have one build design team working on a project. You can be sure that there will be continuity because everyone on the team is on the same page.

<strong>Open and Honest Communication</strong>

The best kind of communication is the one where the team is open and honest. Everyone on this type of team works together to ensure that your home is built and designed the right way with no mistakes. If you are thinking of going with this type of a design, however, you still need to do your research and find the best service to meet your needs.

<strong>The Cons of Design Build</strong>

Of course, as with anything else in the world, there are disadvantages to using design build as well. Read on below for a few of those disadvantages.

<strong>When One is Out, All may be Out</strong>

The only major problem with having one team take care of all of your building, remodeling, and designing needs is the fact that if something happens to one part of the team, you might be stuck waiting for building to resume.

These are just a few of the pros and cons of using this type of service for your needs. From open and honest communication to continuity on the project, this seems to be the best way to go. You can contact Joseph Ketner for more information today.

Coffee shops have massive billboards to advertise their products and buying laundry detergents can be quite an undertaking. Choosing materials for your brand new deck can be just as challenging. Read on below for some tips on what <a href="http://www.josephketnerconstruction.com/">deck</a> materials you should consider when looking to build a modern deck on your home.

<b>Pressure Treated Wood for the Economic</b>

Pressure treated lumber is still the number one most sold lumber on the market today. The reason for this is the fact that it is economical, easy to cut and fasten, and available no matter what coast you live on. The fact that most pressure treated, also known at PT, is made from southern yellow pine and then treated with chemicals to ensure it‚Äôs protection from fungus, wood-eating bugs and rot recommends it as well.

The only cons to pressure treated lumber is that it has a tendency to crack, warp, and split. It is also necessary to maintain the deck in order to prolong it‚Äôs life.

<b>Redwood and Cedar for the Naturally Superior </b>

For homeowners that are purists, the only option in their eyes is either redwood or cedar. Neither of these options is treated with chemicals, making the environmentally friendly among you extra happy. These options also have a rich and colorful wood. The natural chemicals in this wood make them resistant to rot, decay, and certain kinds of insects.

The bad thing about redwood and cedar is that the amount of weather and bug resistance they have will be directly related to the amount of heartwood there is in the boards themselves.

<b>Tropical Hardwoods for the Exotic Minded</b>

Tropical hardwoods are extremely popular for the following reasons.
<ul>
	<li>They are exotic</li>
	<li>Have rich grains</li>
	<li>Extremely hard wood</li>
	<li>Very durable</li>
	<li>Naturally resistant to rot and insects</li>
</ul>
The cons of building a deck with tropical hardwoods are listed below as well.
<ul>
	<li>Expensive when compared to other types of lumber, such as PT</li>
	<li>Dense and heavy</li>
	<li>Hard to cut and drill</li>
	<li>So dense that they don‚Äôt accept stains well</li>
</ul>
<b>Aluminum as a Stay Cool Option </b>

While not a common choice, aluminum is used for deck building by some. Aluminum decking will not rot, warp, splinter, or crack. It is also highly weather resistant and bug resistant as well. It also stays cooler in the sun and doesn‚Äôt attract bugs or catch on fire.

That makes aluminum decking a pretty good option if you think about it. The only drawback is that aluminum is a lot more expensive than any of the other options discussed here today, so you might need to check your budget before making any type of a decision.

These are just a few of the deck materials that you can consider when looking to add a deck onto your home. From aluminum to natural cedar or redwood, there are many options out there; you just need to choose the one that best meets your needs.

One of the factors that makes it difficult is the fact there are so many options to select from available to you. Without a doubt, you need to choose roofing that will look great on your home, but it also needs to be durable. Which product should you choose? Does brand matter? Before you make this decision, consider a few important tips that can make all of the difference in the process.

Think Energy Efficient

While you may be looking for durability, you also want to consider the actual energy efficiency of roofing. Products range significantly. For example, asphalt shingles, one of the most common products, are only moderately efficient, if you purchase the newest styles and designs. On the other hand, installing metal roofing - which no longer is something just for commercial buildings, will allow you to have a much higher level of energy efficiency. These roofs work well to block the sun's rays from heating the interior of the home, reducing your air conditioning use. Consider other eco-friendly products as well. These roofs are also less likely to need maintenance and repair (and some last as long as 40 years.) But, this is just one option available to you.

Look for Warranties

Warranties on roofs are a big factor when buying one type of material over another. They also range from one manufacturer to the next. Several things are important to consider. First, products like asphalt shingles are significantly less expensive than purchasing other products. These tend to have a lifespan up to 20 years. Metal roofs can last 20 to 40 years. Clay or tile roofs tend to have a lifespan of 10 to 15 years. Many other products are out there. When you are buying, though, look beyond the expected lifespan and determine what the warranty from the manufacturer is. This will give you a good indication of durability.

Think Character

Sure, you want a roof that is durable and going to last as long as possible, but that is not all there is to think about when making this type of purchase. Think about the character the roof adds to any space. For example, wood, such as cedar or redwood can make a significant difference in the look of your home. And, they can last up to 25 years. You could go with slate as well, which is more expensive, but offers perhaps the very best in terms of both style and long life - these can last 100 years or longer. You could go with cement or tile, too. Colors, patterns, and overall tile style all impact the look of your home.

When it comes to buying roofing, work closely with a contractor. Have an in-house consultation to discuss your specific needs and ideas. Then, <a href="JosephKetnerConstruction.com">work with your contractor </a>to choose the right combination of cost, warranties, durability, and character. This way, you end up not having to worry about your roof because it is secure and beautiful.
