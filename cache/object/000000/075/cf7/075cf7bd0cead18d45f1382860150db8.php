That‚Äôs why the owner, Joe Ketner, began his ‚ÄúGiving Back‚Äù program.  Joe believes that contributing to organizations that help those who are less fortunate is necessary for communities to thrive.  He feels that supporting organizations in the community, such as Habitat for Humanity and Portland Rescue Mission that aid in getting people out of poverty is one way to strengthen the community, making it a better place to live for everyone.</p>  
<p>Every year JKC will donate a portion of their profits to nonprofit programs that help the community.  Additionally, JKC participates through labor in the Habitat for Humanity Blitzbuild.</p>
