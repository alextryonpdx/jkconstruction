<h4>Important Code Change that Affects Your Home</h4>
The Oregon legislature passed a code change in 2010 in the way building envelopes are assembled, which requires the drainage plane between the exterior cladding and the building envelope for a weather resistant barrier. Before this legislature passed, there were many construction lawsuits. JKC is well versed in the code change. We have repaired many faulty siding installations and know what it takes to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again. If wall insulation is affected, we partner with insulation contractors to take care of the damage.
